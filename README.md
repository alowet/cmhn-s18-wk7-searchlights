Feedback:
Ex 1: A flattened brain like you used before isn't a plane. Planes would still have spatial information.  
Ex 8: This isn't the correct way to do gridsearch (it is more like a nested cross validation). Review your notes from Wk5, remember if you want the score of your gridsearch you only need to call clf.fit(data,labels).best_score_.  However, I admit the question wording wasn't very clear.  
N: Great work here.
